FACE PROSECUTION
 BY JOHN E. LEE
 he a8 re te ee eee

London â€?With British army
trucks already pressed into emer-
gency service to help handle thou-
sands of commuting war workers,
the leaders of London's striking bus
drivers today were reported facing
the threat of government prosecu-
tion in a drastic move to end the
capital's worst transportation tleup
in seven years...

More than 2,000 drivers were-esti-
mated to be on strike in protest
against thelr new summer schedules.
Although 300 of them voted early
this morning,to return to work im-
mediately, in other localities the
strike appeared to be gaining
strength.

Five hundred employes at the
Manchester gas works went on
strike in a dispute over two cents
an hour on their salaries, and serv-
ice to the cityâ€™s 220,000 gas-burning
homes was cut off at once. Wat
industries also were seriously threat-

ened by this new outbreak of work-

stoppage.
Asa result, the political cor-

' respondent of the Daily Expres:
predicted that the government wil
move against the ringleaders unde
the terms of the recently-imposec
anti-strike law, which provides jai
terms and heavy fines for agitating
labor disturbances in key indus:
tries.

 Most Protesters At N.H. Nuclear Site
Remain In Custody Of Authorities
 PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) â€?Hundreds of anti-nuclear power
demonstrators remained in con-
finement Monday in four armories
across the state and some who were
released complained bitterly about
their treatment.

Several demonstrators taken from
the construction site of a nuclear power
plant in Seabrook on Sunday said many
of them were held in National Guard
trucks for up to 15 hours without food or
water. :

The demonstrators, who put an
estimated 2,000 men and women onto
the plant site Saturday for the 24-hour
â€˜â€œâ€˜â€œoccupation,â€™â€?said further sit-ins
would take place in even greater
numbers.

Robin Read, a spokesman for the
sponsoring Clamshell Alliance, said,
â€œIf the Public Service Co. continues
building that plant, then eventually
we'll have to be back with 18,000
 people.â€?Excavation continued Monday by

more than 250 construction workers
who entered the site that had been
cleared by the authorities.

The arrested demonstrators were
funneled through the Portsmouth
armory 16 miles north of Seabrook
where four judges worked through the
night and into late Monday to arraign
them on trespass charges.

Reporters were barred from areas

where the demonstrators were held,
but officials said 1,414 had been

arrested. Roland Jenkins, Gov.
Meldrim Thomsonâ€™s press secretary,
said earlier that about 1,200 had been
arraigned on various charges. But
Clamshell asserted that as many as
1,800 may have been arrested. About
half were held at the armory in
Manchester, the rest in Portsmouth,
Somersworth and Dover.
Demonstrators against the proposed
 seacoast nuclear plant accused
Thomson of intervening in the legal
process.

Read said most demonstrators had
declined bail because authorities â€˜â€˜have
been very arbitrary in the way theyâ€™ve
treated people.â€?
Bail ranged from _ personal
recognizance to $500 in cash, but
Clamshell spokesman said â€œonly a
handfulâ€™â€?of demonstrators were
released. Official figures on the
number released were unavailable and
court authorities only would say that
hearings would be held as soon as they
could be arranged.

Raymond Laporte, 25, said on his
release on bail from the Portsmouth
armory that he stayed in the back of a
military truck from 8:30 p.m. Sunday,
when he was taken from. the
construction site with about 20 others,
until his arraignment at 11:30 a.m.
Monday.

He said he received no food nor water
and when he asked to make a phone call
was told there were no phones in the ar-
mory.

Neither Thomson, state Atty. Gen.
David Souter, nor county prosecutors
were available to discuss the
demonstratorsâ€?charges.

Laporte said he was not advised of his
rights when he was arrested.

Several reporters among a group of
journalists arrested also said they were
not told of rights as required by the U.S.
Supreme Court.

Demonstration leaders had praise,
however, for the peaceful manner in
which the arrests were made Sunday
and Monday. No violence or injuries
were reported.

by news of second death
 PHILADELPHIA (AP)â€”The
dlue-uniformed policemen, many of
them in tears, arrived by the hun-
dreds Friday to honor their slain
comrade. Another 2,000 persons,
mostly in civilian dress, gathered
outside the Ascension of Our Lord
Roman Catholic Chureh.

The funeral for Patrolman John
Trettin, who was gunned down by
sniper fire Feb. 29, was to take on an
even deeper sadness.

At the end of a brief homily, the
Rt. Rev. Msgr. James Howard
announced that another
Philadelphiaâ€˜policeman had died of
a gunshot wound the same morning.
Many of the 1,400 in attendance
gasped openly.

â€œI'd like to ask you to pause for a
moment and pray for policeman
 James Griffin, who died within the
hour,â€?said Msgr. Howard.

During the moment of silence that
followed, many policemen were
seen crying and reaching for han-
dkerchiefs in their pockets.

Griffin, 31, was shot Wednesday
night while beoking a theft suspect
at a police station. He died at 9:40
a.m. in Roxborough Memorial
Hospital after his heart stopped
twice during the morning. Though

. critically wounded, there had been
reports his condition was im-
proving.

â€œThis was the largest outpouring
of policemen ever in the city for a
policemanâ€™s funeral,â€?said Chief
Inspector Richard F. Bridgeford,
who was in charge of the police
arrangements for the funeral.
 He said 230 local and state police
departments from New York City,
Connecticut, New Jersey and
Delaware, in addition to Penn-
sylvania, were there. About 250 cars
joined in a 10-mile procession after
the funeral.

Trettin, 23, was shot in the head
Feb. 25 while investigating reports
someone was firing a rifle in the
area of a Philadelphia housing
project. Three youths have been
charged with the shooting.

Members of the Stakeout Unit, to
which Trettin was assigned, bore his
casket. Patrolman Richard
Malinowski, his partner, was at the
head of the procession.

Trettinâ€™s widow and parents at-
tended the funeral, but the officer's
three young children were not seen.
His widow and mother appeared
near collapse as they left the
church, and had to be helped down
the steps.

Outside, the 90-member Stakeout
Unit lined the steps as the casket
was cartied to a waiting hearse and
the Police and Firemanâ€™s Band
plaved â€˜Nearer My God To Thee.â€? ",0
